Goal: Use _dplyr_ and _ggplot2_ packages in R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore the variables, 
structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set. 

I choose to analyze the [online news popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity) dataset from UCI's Machine learning repository. The data set files can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00332/)

Here are the main files for the project:

__Project Report R code__ _Final_project.R_ (R code for the project.)

__Project Report__ : _Final_project.pdf_ (A .pdf file detailing the entire analysis and findings.)
