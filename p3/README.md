Goal: Use _dplyr_ and _ggplot2_ packages in R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore the variables, 
structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set. 

I choose to analyze the [online news popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity) dataset from UCI's Machine learning repository. Here are the main files: 

__Dataset__: _OnlineNewsPopularity.csv_ 

__Attributes__: _Dataset_attributes.txt_

__Project Report R code__ _Final_project.R_
