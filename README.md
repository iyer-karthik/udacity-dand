# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

## P0: Bay Area Bike Share 

The goal of this project is to identify the key steps of the data analysis process and walk through a basic exploratory data analysis on Bay Area Bike Share data.

## P1: Investigate a Dataset using NumPy and Pandas

In this project, I chose the https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic[Titanic] dataset and investigated it using NumPy and Pandas. I go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings. The goal of this project was to get used to *numpy* and *pandas*, 2 of the most widely used packages in Python for data analysis.

## P2: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

In this project, I chose a particular area of the world from  https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. I then defined a schema, converting the cleaned data into a SQL database and query the database to glean insights from the data. The goal of this project was to implement data cleaning techniques *programmatically* before starting to analyze the data as often times the integrity of the data is suspect.

## P3: Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, I apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying
relationships of a data set of my choice. The goal of this project was to learn to do visual exploration of various features of a gicen data set before a more thorough analysis. In this project, I primarily made use of *ggplot2* and *dplyr* packages in R programming language to accomplish the visual exploration.
