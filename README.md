# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
Here are the projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

## P0: Bay Area Bike Share 

Identify the key steps of the data analysis process and walk through a basic exploratory data analysis on Bay Area Bike
Share data. Thi goal of this project is to get acquainted with Jupyter notebooks and learn to ask the right questions for analyzing a given data set.

## P1: Investigate a Dataset using NumPy and Pandas

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis
process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings. The goal of this project is to get used to 
*numpy* and *pandas*, 2 of the most widely used packages in Python for data analysis.

## P2: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality 
of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of 
the world of your choice. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project. For this project, I chose SQL for queries. The goal of this project is to implement data cleaning techniques *programmatically* before starting to analyze the data as often times the integrity of the data is suspect.

## P3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying
relationships of a data set of your choice. The goal of this project to learn to do visual exploration of various features of our data set before we go on to do a more thorough analysis. In this project, I primarily made use of *ggplot2* and *dplyr* packages in R programming language to accomplish the visual exploration.
