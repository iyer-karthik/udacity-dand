 
In this project we take look at a dataset and understand what questions once can answer using it.
We then use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we are most interested in. We don't use any statistics or machine learning and 
our findings are tentative.

The goal of this project is to get acquainted with using NumPy and Pandas, two of the most important packages for 
data analysis. For this project, we use the 
[Titanic Dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv)
which contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. 
One can view a description of this dataset on [the Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), 
where the data was obtained.
