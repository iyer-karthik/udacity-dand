**Overview**

The goal of this project is to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect)
We will learn a little bit about the experiment and create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task.
We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret the results in terms of our hypotheses.
